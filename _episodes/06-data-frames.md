## Data Frames

So far we have covered data structures which contain all the same basic data type. But 
one of R's most powerful features is its ability to deal with tabular data -
like what you might already have in a spreadsheet or a CSV. **Data Frames** are built from 
vectors but differ from matrices in the aspect that they can contain vectors of different 
data types.

To build a data frame from existing vectors we use the `data.frame()` command. Let's build 
a data frame for with some information on cats.

~~~
coat <- c("calico", "black", "tabby")
weight <- c(2.1, 5.0, 3.2)
likes_string <- c(1,0,1)

cats <- data.frame(coat, weight, likes_string)
cats
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
    coat weight likes_string
1 calico    2.1            1
2  black    5.0            0
3  tabby    3.2            1
~~~
{: .output}

We can begin exploring our dataset right away, pulling out columns by specifying
them using the `$` operator:


~~~
cats$weight
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 2.1 5.0 3.2
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
cats$coat
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] calico black  tabby 
Levels: black calico tabby
~~~
{: .output}

Just like we did with vectors, we can perform operations on columns within our data frame:


~~~
## Say we discovered that the scale weighs two Kg light:
cats$weight + 2
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 4.1 7.0 5.2
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
paste("My cat is", cats$coat)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "My cat is calico" "My cat is black"  "My cat is tabby" 
~~~
{: .output}


Try this challenge to see different ways of interacting with data frames:

{: .challenge}



Let's modify our data frame by adding an additional column which will hold the age of each 
of the cats. As we saw in the previous challenge, columns in a data frame are vectors which 
we construct using the `c()` function as before:

~~~
age <- c(2,3,5,12)
cats
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
    coat weight likes_string
1 calico    2.1            1
2  black    5.0            0
3  tabby    3.2            1
~~~
{: .output}

We can then add this as a column in our data frame by using the `cbind()` function:


~~~
cats <- cbind(cats, age)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
Error in data.frame(..., check.names = FALSE): arguments imply differing number of rows: 3, 4
~~~
{: .error}

Why didn't this work? Of course, R wants to see one element in our new column
for every row in the table. Since our data frame only has 3 rows, we can only add a column 
with 3 elements. Let's try that again:


~~~
age <- c(4,5,8)
cats <- cbind(cats, age)
cats
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
    coat weight likes_string age
1 calico    2.1            1   4
2  black    5.0            0   5
3  tabby    3.2            1   8
~~~
{: .output}

Now how about adding rows - in this case, we saw last time that the rows of a
data.frame are made of lists:


~~~
newRow <- list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9)
cats <- rbind(cats, newRow)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
Warning in `[<-.factor`(`*tmp*`, ri, value = "tortoiseshell"): invalid
factor level, NA generated
~~~
{: .error}

Our list had the correct number of elements, so why did R give us a warning? It looks like 
the error occurred in the `coat` column. Let's take a closer look.

~~~
class(cats$coat)
~~~
{: .r}

~~~
[1] "factor"
~~~
{: .output}


So in our `cats` data frame, the `coat` column is a data class named a **factor**. Factors 
are data classes that R uses to handle categorical data. 
When we tried adding a new row to the `cats` data frame, the new data contained a level of 
`coat` that we had not previously used.  This is something we need to look out for - when 
R creates a factor, it only
allows whatever is originally there when our data was first loaded, which was
'black', 'calico' and 'tabby' in our case. Anything new that doesn't fit into
one of its categories is rejected as nonsense and is replaced by an `NA` until we explicitly add that as a
*level* in the factor:


~~~
levels(cats$coat)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "black"  "calico" "tabby" 
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
levels(cats$coat) <- c(levels(cats$coat), 'tortoiseshell')
cats <- rbind(cats, list("tortoiseshell", 3.3, TRUE, 9))
~~~
{: .r}

Alternatively, we can change a factor column to a character vector; we lose the
handy categories of the factor, but can subsequently add any word we want to the
column without babysitting the factor levels:


~~~
str(cats)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
'data.frame':	5 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ coat        : Factor w/ 4 levels "black","calico",..: 2 1 3 NA 4
 $ weight      : num  2.1 5 3.2 3.3 3.3
 $ likes_string: int  1 0 1 1 1
 $ age         : num  4 5 8 9 9
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
cats$coat <- as.character(cats$coat)
str(cats)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
'data.frame':	5 obs. of  4 variables:
 $ coat        : chr  "calico" "black" "tabby" NA ...
 $ weight      : num  2.1 5 3.2 3.3 3.3
 $ likes_string: int  1 0 1 1 1
 $ age         : num  4 5 8 9 9
~~~
{: .output}

We now know how to add rows and columns to our data.frame in R - but in our work
we've accidentally added a garbage row:


~~~
cats
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    2.1            1   4
2         black    5.0            0   5
3         tabby    3.2            1   8
4          <NA>    3.3            1   9
5 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
~~~
{: .output}

We can ask for a data.frame minus this offending row:


~~~
cats[-4,]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    2.1            1   4
2         black    5.0            0   5
3         tabby    3.2            1   8
5 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
~~~
{: .output}

Notice the comma with nothing after it to indicate we want to drop the entire fourth row.

Note: We could also remove both new rows at once by putting the row numbers
inside of a vector: `cats[c(-4,-5),]`

Alternatively, we can drop all rows with `NA` values:


~~~
na.omit(cats)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    2.1            1   4
2         black    5.0            0   5
3         tabby    3.2            1   8
5 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
~~~
{: .output}

Let's reassign the output to `cats`, so that our changes will be permanent:


~~~
cats <- na.omit(cats)
~~~
{: .r}

The key to remember when adding data to a data.frame is that *columns are
vectors or factors, and rows are lists.* We can also glue two dataframes
together with `rbind`:


~~~
cats <- rbind(cats, cats)
cats
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
            coat weight likes_string age
1         calico    2.1            1   4
2          black    5.0            0   5
3          tabby    3.2            1   8
5  tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
11        calico    2.1            1   4
21         black    5.0            0   5
31         tabby    3.2            1   8
51 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
~~~
{: .output}
But now the row names are unnecessarily complicated. We can remove the rownames,
and R will automatically re-name them sequentially:


~~~
rownames(cats) <- NULL
cats
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
           coat weight likes_string age
1        calico    2.1            1   4
2         black    5.0            0   5
3         tabby    3.2            1   8
4 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9
5        calico    2.1            1   4
6         black    5.0            0   5
7         tabby    3.2            1   8
8 tortoiseshell    3.3            1   9

{: .challenge}

So far, you've seen the basics of manipulating data.frames with our cat data;
now, let's use those skills to digest a more realistic dataset. For the remainder of our 
lesson, we are going to use the `gapminder` data set built into the `gapminder` package.

If you did not install the `gapminder` package with our previous challenge, you can do so 
now with the `install.packages()` command:

~~~
install.packages("gapminder")
~~~
{: .r}

If you have already installed the `gapminder` package, go ahead and load it now. You can tell 
R to load the package by clicking the checkbox next to its listing in the package tab of the 
lower left pane in R studio. Or you can load it by using the 'library()' command:

~~~
library('gapminder')
~~~
{: .r}

To make sure our analysis is reproducible, we should put the code
into a script file so we can come back to it later.

Note that the library command can be used within your scripts to load any packages that your 
scripts need. To make your scripts easy to read by others, you will want to put these commands 
at the top of your script file. You can learn more about writing easy to read code in the 
supplemental lesson [Writing Good Software](https://carriebrown.github.io/r-novice-gapminder-2/07-wrap-up/).


Let's investigate gapminder a bit; the first thing we should always do is check
out what the data looks like with `str`:


~~~
str(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
'data.frame':	1704 obs. of  6 variables:
 $ country  : Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
 $ year     : int  1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977 1982 1987 1992 1997 ...
 $ pop      : num  8425333 9240934 10267083 11537966 13079460 ...
 $ continent: Factor w/ 5 levels "Africa","Americas",..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ...
 $ lifeExp  : num  28.8 30.3 32 34 36.1 ...
 $ gdpPercap: num  779 821 853 836 740 ...
~~~
{: .output}

We can also examine individual columns of the data.frame with our `typeof` function:


~~~
typeof(gapminder$year)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
typeof(gapminder$lifeExp)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "double"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
typeof(gapminder$country)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "integer"
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
str(gapminder$country)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
 Factor w/ 142 levels "Afghanistan",..: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...
~~~
{: .output}

We can also interrogate the data.frame for information about its dimensions;
remembering that `str(gapminder)` said there were 1704 observations of 6
variables in gapminder, what do you think the following will produce, and why?


~~~
length(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 6
~~~
{: .output}

A fair guess would have been to say that the length of a data.frame would be the
number of rows it has (1704), but this is not the case; remember, a data.frame
is a *list of vectors and factors*:


~~~
typeof(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "list"
~~~
{: .output}

When `length` gave us 6, it's because gapminder is built out of a list of 6
columns. To get the number of rows and columns in our dataset, try:


~~~
nrow(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1704
~~~
{: .output}



~~~
ncol(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 6
~~~
{: .output}

Or, both at once:


~~~
dim(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1704    6
~~~
{: .output}

We'll also likely want to know what the titles of all the columns are, so we can
ask for them later:


~~~
colnames(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] "country"   "year"      "pop"       "continent" "lifeExp"   "gdpPercap"
~~~
{: .output}

At this stage, it's important to ask ourselves if the structure R is reporting
matches our intuition or expectations; do the basic data types reported for each
column make sense? If not, we need to sort any problems out now before they turn
into bad surprises down the road, using what we've learned about how R
interprets data, and the importance of *strict consistency* in how we record our
data.

Once we're happy that the data types and structures seem reasonable, it's time
to start digging into our data proper. Check out the first few lines:


~~~
head(gapminder)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
      country continent year lifeExp      pop gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan      Asia 1952  28.801  8425333  779.4453

3 Afghanistan      Asia 1962  31.997 10267083  853.1007
4 Afghanistan      Asia 1967  34.020 11537966  836.1971

### Subsetting Data Frames

Remember the data frames are lists underneath the hood, so similar rules
apply. However they are also two dimensional objects:

`[` with one argument will act the same was as for lists, where each list
element corresponds to a column. The resulting object will be a data frame:


~~~
head(gapminder[3])
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
       pop
1  8425333
2  9240934
3 10267083
4 11537966
5 13079460
6 14880372
~~~
{: .output}

Similarly, `[[` will act to extract *a single column*:


~~~
head(gapminder[["lifeExp"]])
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 28.801 30.332 31.997 34.020 36.088 38.438
~~~
{: .output}

And `$` provides a convenient shorthand to extract columns by name:


~~~
head(gapminder$year)
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
[1] 1952 1957 1962 1967 1972 1977
~~~
{: .output}

With two arguments, `[` subsets on typical matrix format, where the first argument indicates 
rows and the second argument indicates columns. Note that if one of the arguments is blank, R will 
default to include all of the rows or columns:


~~~
gapminder[1:3,]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
1 Afghanistan 1952  8425333      Asia  28.801  779.4453
2 Afghanistan 1957  9240934      Asia  30.332  820.8530
3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007
~~~
{: .output}

If we subset a single row, the result will be a data frame (because
the elements are mixed types):


~~~
gapminder[3,]
~~~
{: .r}



~~~
      country year      pop continent lifeExp gdpPercap
3 Afghanistan 1962 10267083      Asia  31.997  853.1007
~~~
{: .output}

But for a single column the result will be a vector (this can
be changed with the third argument, `drop = FALSE`).

> ## Challenge 5
>
> 1. Why does `gapminder[1:20]` return an error? How does it differ from `gapminder[1:20, ]`?
>
>
> 2. Create a new `data.frame` called `gapminder_small` that only contains rows 1 through 9
> and 19 through 23. You can do this in one or two steps.
>
> > ## Solution to challenge 5

> > 1.  `gapminder` is a data.frame so needs to be subsetted on two dimensions. `gapminder[1:20, ]` subsets the data to give the first 20 rows and all columns.
